## Tech Stack

- **Language:** Kotlin
- **Architecture:** MVVM (ViewModel + Repository + StateFlow)
- **Networking:** Retrofit2 + OkHttp
- **Async:** Kotlin Coroutines
- **Image loading:** Coil
- **UI:** Material Design 3, ViewBinding, RecyclerView
- **API:** [football-data.org](https://www.football-data.org/) (free tier)

## Architecture

The app follows MVVM pattern with a clean separation of layers:
- **UI layer** — Fragments + ViewBinding, observe StateFlow from ViewModel
- **ViewModel layer** — holds UI state, triggers data loading, exposes StateFlow
- **Repository layer** — single source of truth, maps DTOs to domain models
- **Data layer** — Retrofit API interface + DTOs with @SerializedName
